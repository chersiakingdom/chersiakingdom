### Hi there üíò 
This page opened in May 2021, and I'm slowly uploading what I've been studying.

***

### üòä Who I am?
Senior at **Kyung Hee University**, double majoring in Software Convergence and Industrial Engineering.<br/>
dream of becoming a researcher with significant influence in data analysis academia. <br/>
interested in Big Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence in the medical field, and Neuroscience.<br/>
espect people with affection and passion to work in their academic field, and who take on valuable challenges to it. :D

### üíº Career 
**Undergraduate Researcher** at Artificial Intelligence & Medical Science Lab, Kyung Hee University, Korea, 2021.09 ~ 2022.09. <br/>
**Student Intern** at Computer and Information Technology, Purdue University, United States, 2022.08~2022.12 <br/>


### üåπ PROJECTS
- **1) User experience analysis based on review data using natural language processing and deep learning, and development of an end-to-end visualization web service, 2021.01 ~2021.09. fin**  
This project includes crawling, data EDA, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and other DL/ML technologies. The web service developed as a result of the project is an end-to-end platform. When users enter the page URL where they want to analyze comments, we crawl all the comments on the entered site, analyze and visualize collected comments in several ways. This allows users to view many people's opinions in a single click. Available sites are Naver News, Naver shopping malls, and Naver movie sites; Naver is a search website most used by Koreans.

- **2) Implementation of EEG-based user-friendly music composition algorithm using machine learning, 2021.09~2021.12. fin**   
The project aims to compose music with brain waves. We go further from "the simple purpose of making music with brain waves" to "user-friendly, personalized music," which is to compose music that expresses the user's 'emotions' well. Listening to music that fully expresses one's psychological state (emotion) was expected to be an opportunity to check and reconstruct one's mental health on one's own. This study includes feature extraction from EEG, emotion analysis of signals, composition, implementation of music algorithms using several features, and development of end-to-end frameworks.

- **3) Multimodal sentiment classification using cognitive language processing data using dynamic functional brain networks and XLnet models., 2022,03~ 2022.09**<br/>
Although brain activity and gaze data generated from reading can be used for natural language processing, many papers do not focus on the various characteristics of each modality. Instead, they simply extract and analyze a few features from each cognitive language processing data. In this study, we tried to extract various features from each modality and combine features into several cases. Here, it was confirmed how each combination of features contributes to the sentiment classification task's improvement. I am preparing to publish the paper as a first author,, and more detailed information will be provided later.

- **4)  Safe Route Recommendation based on Crime Risk Prediction with Urban and Crime data, 2022.09~2022.12** <br/>
Public safety is one of the main concerns in the United States since crime rates are rise in recent years. While several papers have discussed methods of recommending safe routes, they do not analyze all the factors that could affect the riskiness of the road. Apart from the other papers, we propose an innovative application that recommends safe routes for individuals based on road risk prediction. It is expected that all the results analyzed in this paper can be used as reference material for community safety. I am preparing to publish the paper as a first author, and more detailed information will be provided later.
